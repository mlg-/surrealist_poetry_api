They don't understand the pain,

1

they pushed me to succeed

2

and wait in a corner for the bus 
 at the passing cars. 
leaving me nothing   
he like a tortilla tho jus the same, 
So, Reggae King, your time here is done, 
I only wish that I had known   
pilot bit,   
they pushed me to succeed   
when the food color, 
sucks!   
A whisper from across the room 
I am out of crazy pills 
Yet there is nothing to be done   
 this should'nt be ending now  
It’s 2:13 PM, I feel the rumble, I hear the call 
Shit's crap, housed in the loo.    
bit by bit,    
sayin all that and more, 
 code while tripping real nicely  
has seen me;

3

but  
they pushed me to succeed   
And I ain't talkin' shit, no, 
are waiting 
gin and it,   
You were getting dressed

4

My work is done. Remember what you heard:

5

Our love burns alight.  
under it,   
 Cold stone marks brightness made dark  
this is shit. 
Where were you? Where ARE you?   
cant get enough unless you go make more, 
Shoeless wanderer.

6

Or have to take one. If it's not your 'poo'   
hope for the best man 
Eatin' fame, he lives it up, 
Jack yourself up on adderall or ritalin and sit and grin   
he tells me about the afterparty   
the best day of my life   
Flickering. Shifting.

7

text optional,  
Our love burns alight.  
This 'shit'. It can be real; some of it's fun;   
and how we'll drive to it   
I'll soon hold in my hands   
I hope you do not mind!   
They call me conquest, when tyrants reign tall   
 Flickering. Shifting. 
His mother calling "Reggae!"

8

I made a Poet disappear -   
Father, where were you? Where were you?   
bit by bit,    
This 'shit'. It can be real; some of it's fun;   
cause he hide himself twice, catching all the mice, 
When it's rough be tough 
And home's just round the corner, 
"Fuck this shit!" you, dear Reader, may rejoin.   
She's told, in some rougher parts of the world   
I wear my heart on my sleeve 
catcha mice  
the best day of my life   
A soul made of flames  
Let's hear it for another day, another sunday wasted, 
i scream at the oncoming bus "I WANT TO FUCKING SLEEP" 
and I'll return the favour, babe.

9

 Still I miss your warmth 
isn't it,   
Shoeless wanderer.  
Am I even alone? I hope so. I hope so.   
this is shit,

10

red, 
All I write is shit 
but disappointment. 
where all the friends of my youth   
Of serregated branches, 
(or if you do you 'don't' is how that goes).   
when I wake up for work   
 is not calling my auntie  
Is shit, behind a *meat digested* mask.   
And we begin the process of fecal fission 
Five kindsa cheese 
He or a she, or even it   
 pretending to be a baboon  
Welcome! Welcome! When before we must begin   
under it,   
To compliment her. What will never stick

11

shit, i say, and climb into      
You were getting dressed 
 Atmosphere forever bruised  
 And drunk, stepped out to throw rocks  
I close the door with haste, and undue my belt 
the kind of person I want to be   
Falling, finding peace within, 
STOP already?   
 at last he checked the fuel gauge 
That's how I've always felt 
to act using discretion  
The bench and bar from near the wall 
"Shiteyes" is a thing only shitheads say.   
library

12

Five kindsa cheese 
And the sexist becomes irate 
My greatest regret

13

so my face will itch 
red, 
It blossoms and grows   
They call me conquest, when tyrants reign tall   
My work is done. Remember what you heard:   
Which is very unkind   
the cat saved a life that day 
Now, politicians are SHIT -   
Performing in the metro, 
I'll soon hold in my hands   
under it,   
ask for it,   
and ana come over  
 I have failed you. 
Which are of course metaphores   
Let down your dreads and let loose your bong, 
footprints in the sand.

14

But mom, mom, mom?

15

but i gotta put this down, 
"Why not give me a turn?" 
this labyrinth of dreary halls   
he like a tortilla tho jus the same, 
If on a shingle, it is even yum,   
To compliment her. What will never stick   
has seen me;   
Our love burns alight.  
You were getting dressed 
For cats turn to tigers,   
 My world is cold without you  
Is shit, behind a *meat digested* mask.

From the poop of the player

You were getting dressed 
Oh, I proclaim, naked-pale, in the plaza-   
 My world is cold without you  
coffee on the table,

17

 at last he checked the fuel gauge 
I hoed him and I know   
They call me famine, when locusts crawl   
 Rough stubble; deep, long kisses  
so my face will itch 
in a Ferrari LaFerrari   
Or have to take one. If it's not your 'poo'   
i scream at the oncoming bus "I WANT TO FUCKING SLEEP" 
I'll soon hold in my hands   
'sperience 'sperience the cat gone wild, 
Wow, thanks for the gold!   
hawk and spit,   
People walking past him, 
lead him away from the double doors,

Shit happens. Shit hits fans, all over town.   
On the other end of a hearty bite   
It makes a dif   
 Bring back the summer 
Keep me awake

STOP already?

my parents wanted someone brilliant—   
Set me free from these beige walls   
Welcome! Welcome! When before we must begin   
I love holding you 
i tell the book "get the fuck away from me!"

Eats it up, he eats it up,

You are judging me and that

Whether you talk it or are told to eat it

 Cold stone marks brightness made dark  
A PERSON easier than in days of yore   
It's not like I deserve it   
baseball mitt,   
because we have to face it;   
This place of hope and relief has become quite eerie

Ten years ago

 Guilty conscience clear

My greatest regret

Shit pays you in shitcoin.

Shit happens. Check your mat.

Maybe if your dad is rich...   
I'm a total disappointment

But mom, mom, mom?

Something all agree on isn't it?   
Trying not to be "that guy" 
whilst I walk past my cohorts   
From the poop of the player   
I was arrested in Bucharest.   
For the Reggae King in action, 
 pretending to be a baboon  
World gone mad burns hot 
 pretending to be a baboon  
Still, at least don't behave like a buffoon 
Rough stubble; deep, long kisses

But the fault is mine, and mine alone   
As I add plate after plate 
But I won’t ever forget the times we had, my poop buddy and me

 Body and soul rest. 
Surrounded, I'm trapped  
Shit still blows... out your bum.   
Falling, finding peace within, 
But I want to know more 
Timid ambition

When I'm topping a pizza

When suddenly, I feel the rush of air, I hear the door crack

pEOple around look at me; i turn around to make sure nobody

"will you feel my face, book, will you???"

75

Like arrows and when you click   
A loveless desert wasteland

76

"The worst shit in life is free"   
where all the friends of my youth   
becus my cat doesnt bother but he likes to dip, 
so    
text optional,  
but disappointment. 
 Body and soul rest. 
to do those horrid things    
or your career is fucking DEAD.   
over failure 
I did not mean to do this thing   
Let down your dreads and let loose your bong, 
who click away at their reports 
the best day of my life

77

As nervous as Lincoln at a fecal emancipation 
chickens,  
"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm-mmmmmmmmrrrrruummmmmmmmmmmmmm" Says Whale 
isn't it,   
this is shit,   
 Bring back the summer 
You told me that you loved me 
readmit,   
Shit happens. And it BLOWS!   
this is shit.

78

Five kindsa cheese. 
meows at the door,

79

There's no telling how fast   
I don't want to wake you up 
There's a fire in my head  
when the food color, 
 Cold stone marks brightness made dark  
When suddenly, I feel the rush of air, I hear the door crack 
to a crumbling house by the sea   
Watching me make gainz for dayz 
the cat has to not lay out 
be 
roller bit,   
the moment when— at last— I'm free. 
reverse split,   
pilot bit,

80

recommit,   
Gives to each its own effect   
You told me that you loved me 
he tells me about the afterparty   
 My world is cold without you  
and a moon, just to erase

81

The presenter who introduces me   
Though not a nappy full... Just ask your mum.   
During the act, I wait with anxious anticipation  
cant get enough unless you go make more, 
leaving me nothing   
     Love, widely misrepresented  
work permit,   
Today is   
I lock my computer, stand up, and proceed to my stall 
For five kindsa cheese 
He or a she, or even it   
becus my cat doesnt bother but he likes to dip, 
that my parents don't like me   
to do those horrid things    
 No need of healing. 
Still I miss your warmth

82

Shit happens. Check your mat.   
"Fuck this shit!" you, dear Reader, may rejoin.   
and throw it on the floor, and stomp on it     
It makes a dif   
 Body and soul rest. 
resubmit,   
Do you feel at home  
 But we fight in the shadows.  
but pay the bills off, one by one   
     and my heart keeps fueling it.   
Bench press, destroyer of curls. 
Set me free from my slow death

83

he like a tortilla tho jus the same, 
hawk and spit,   
he tells me about the afterparty

84

double knit,    
even if you try, with all your might.   
throw a fit,   
As nervous as Lincoln at a fecal emancipation 
roosters too, 
Like arrows and when you click   
chips all day, and nothin else to say, 
Something all agree on isn't it?   
but i gotta put this down, 
toilet kit,   
a failure of victory   
Oh. I'm getting handcuffed in the plaza.

85

about it,   
I pleaded insanity from my grandma's death   
 at the passing cars. 
the least bit,   
he like a tortilla tho jus the same, 
This 'shit'. It can be real; some of it's fun;   
You open up stall 4 as is tradition, 
Today is   
escaping is the best feeling ever   
ask for it,   
Falling, finding peace within, 
but they've seen me 
It makes a dif   
otherwise everything would   
cant get enough unless you go make more, 
Where were you? Where ARE you?

86

for a newspaper label, 
I sit down to contemplate 
and ana come over

87

holy writ,   
Dumbell forgotten, now it lays

88

so my face will itch 
strokes for different Folks:   
on my potate, 
on the sidewalk i raise the book to my face -   
Yet there is nothing to be done   
this is shit. 
from Excel files and coffee breath

89

and wait in a corner for the bus 
I grunt with effort, you moan with pain 
 Guilty conscience clear 
Can't shake these feelings  
but I cannot   
*DIFFERENT*   
I lock my computer, stand up, and proceed to my stall 
Without it I can't breathe 
Let down your dreads and let loose your bong, 
A whisper from across the room 
Yo, give it up, 
 peddle home to bed. 
They call me famine, when locusts crawl   
and throw it on the floor, and stomp on it     
sucks!   
Alone.

90

under it,   
My chest is out of this world 
drilling bit,   
Five kindsa cheese? 
From the poop of the player   
the trappings of my corporate cage 
Could you live with that?   
Three abreast we weep  
 footprints in the sand. 
text optional,  
Beautiful mosaic tiles zig zag on the floor 
this labyrinth of dreary halls   
I count the days 'til I escape   
In Budapest. 
the least bit,

91

to do those horrid things    
at six in the morning   
library

92

A whisper from across the room 
STOP already?   
3rd one from the left, with the scratch on the door 
Am I even alone? I hope so. I hope so.   
I finish my business, and vanish without you seeing my face 
And home's just round the corner, 
cause i wont eat sooner,

93

Though a grin on those things is not much like a grin   
strokes for different Folks:   
Keep me awake  
but slip on a banana 
the smell of a sewer, 
I'm a total disappointment   
but only in the way   
Eatin' fame, he lives it up, 
not at all of yours, 
sucks!

94

I sit down to contemplate 
Cop cars on his tail, 
The idiot becomes a millionaire   
under it,

95

My chest is out of this world 
from Excel files and coffee breath   
You were getting dressed 
over failure 
Oh. I'm getting handcuffed in the plaza. 
and throw it on the floor, and stomp on it     
meows at the door, 
It's that time of year again, mom, mom, mom?   
It is shitty for that person too   
They call me war, when buildings fall   
 and I'll return the favour, babe.  
Shit happens. And it BLOWS!   
She bickered, he drank.  
Father, where were you? Where were you?   
Performing in the metro, 
got lost in the bottle, 
Three abreast we weep  
Five kindsa cheese 
 peddle home to bed. 
Shit's fucking; straight or gay.

96

"The worst shit in life is free"   
If a girl's like it's house - built out of brick   
Alone.   
Beautiful mosaic tiles zig zag on the floor 
"The worst shit in life is free"   
#[[[ ROARRR! ]]] 
he like a tortilla tho jus the same, 
Yo, give it up, 
I wear my heart on my sleeve 
I made a Poet disappear -   
when the food color, 
otherwise everything would   
recommit,   
Kleptokitty stuns owner 
Woke up from a dream

97

                                    the bus --        
 Trash cans topple, bored children  
they've never truly accepted   
 A loveless desert wasteland  
who click away at their reports 
It makes a dif

98

but pay the bills off, one by one   
catcha mice  
ask for it,   
A thing both man and dog may 'do'. Surprise!:   
It's that time of year again, mom, mom, mom?   
Five kindsa cheese 
becus my cat doesnt bother but he likes to dip, 
I love holding you 
recommit,   
 Death has helped their master here  
Oh, to be naked and pale, in the plaza...   
Oh you better believe 
I begin to lose hope, all seems dark and dreary  
When we shake hands    
From the poop of the player   
to a crumbling house by the sea

99

 the conforming dirt 
You do not touch it. Don't make me repeat it.   
The bench and bar from near the wall 
when the food color, 
She bickered, he drank.  
 I have failed you. 
over failure 
It is shitty for that person too   
So, Reggae King, your time here is done, 
they are late, 
The sitting shitter shits, and having shat   
Though a grin on those things is not much like a grin   
a failure of victory   
I only wish that I had known

and how we'll drive to it   
Living for reaction, 
Shit still blows... out your bum.
